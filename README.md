# Under development.  This code is part of my graduate research into using convolutional neural networks to analyze complicated microscope data.

# Main code is in "Neural Networks for Atomic Force Microscopy.ipynb" and currently contains all functions needed to load data, train a neural network, test and evaluate the quality of the trained network, and use the network to predict values for new test data.
